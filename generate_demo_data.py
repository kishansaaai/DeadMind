        EQUIPMENT: B-101 Primary Steam Boiler
        DATE: Aug 2016
        AUTHOR: Rajan Sharma (Senior Boiler & Turbine Lead)
        
        OBSERVATION: 
        Boiler pressure fluctuating approximately 0.3 bar at 3am, with feedwater flow remaining stable.
        
        DIAGNOSIS & ACTIONS:
        I checked the feedwater control valve positioner calibration first, not the system setpoints. 
        Discovered feedwater control valve positioner drift at low ambient temperatures during the night shift.
        Calibrated the positioner feedback arm and lubricated the mechanical linkages. Pressure stabilized post-calibration.
        
        RECOMMENDATION:
        Always perform verification of mechanical positioner alignment before adjusting digital controller loop gains.

        OBSERVATION:
        During startup, minor pressure fluctuations of 0.3 bar were noted, followed by high vibration alerts on the auxiliary steam line.
        
        DIAGNOSIS & RESOLUTION:
        Feedwater flow was reported as stable by shift operators, but valve positioner drift was observed. 
        Re-calibrated the valve feedback system which corrected the boiler pressure fluctuations.
